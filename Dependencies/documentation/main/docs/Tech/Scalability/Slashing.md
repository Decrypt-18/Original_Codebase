Slashing is one of the most desired features of Incognito’s core protocol where it comes to help increase reliability and validity for the network.

### How does slashing help the network?

The network will be able to detect inoperative and misbehaving validators and replace them with better validators. A node is called inoperative and gets slashed when it doesn’t contribute 50% of required votes in an epoch where “required votes” is defined as the average number of blocks produced in a particular shard. **If a node is slashed, the 1750 staked PRV would be returned back to the node operator and they may re-stake at a later time**. After slashing has been active for some time, this will increase the stability of the network as the network will utilize “healthy” validators.

**Rewards from slashed nodes will be distributed evenly to remaining validators in a committee**. This will help increase fairness among validators and motivate node owners to maintain their nodes’ operation.
