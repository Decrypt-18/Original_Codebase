This directory (WORK) was setup by two former Incognito dev members. They were attemtping to get a working testnet online for us, however, they ran into some issues.

They have informed us of the following:


1. understand incognito-cli and all its feature, start with generate keys, you will need to gen 64 keys or more.


2. put the key into keylist.json, follow the pre define format.


3. check config and params inside folder config (testnet1 and testnet2), there a punch of checkpoint to enable feature, the checkpoint is number epoch.


so if we start new testnet we can set epoch to 1 for the feature to enable. start privacy v2 at epoch 0 or 1


set the number of fixed node, max number of nodes in config


4. check the run.sh, it has a list of command to start all node in same server.
